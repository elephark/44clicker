# 44clicker

Replacement for mechanical clickers for judging yoyo freestyles.

## Features
- Plus and minus clicks in ones and threes.
- Separate keys for each type of major deduct currently in use.
- All of the above, plus the appropriate totals, clearly displayed.
- Reset key, and also an "undo last reset" feature in case you hit it by accident.

Turn off autorepeat in your OS keyboard settings. 

Built with Qt 5.14.0. Eventually the goal is to have a statically-linked build for anyone to download and use right away, but for now you'll need Qt installed to run it yourself.
