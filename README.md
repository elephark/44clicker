# 44clicker

Replacement for mechanical clickers for judging yoyo freestyles.

## Features
- Plus and minus clicks in ones and threes.
- Separate keys for each type of major deduct currently in use.
- All of the above, plus the appropriate totals, clearly displayed.
- Reset key, and also an "undo last reset" feature in case you hit it by accident.
- Timer, showing the elapsed and remaining time in the freestyle.

Turn off autorepeat in your OS keyboard settings. 

Built with Qt 5.12.6. Eventually the goal is to have a statically-linked build for anyone to download and use right away, but for now you'll need Qt installed to run it yourself.
